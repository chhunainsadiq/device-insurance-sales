Here create React app is being for the boilerplate setup. 

## Folder Structure:
For folder structure it used or follows the best paractices 
mentioned here 
https://medium.com/@alexmngn/how-to-better-organize-your-react-applications-2fd3ea1920f1


## Main Used Libraries:

- redux-toolkit: state management
- styled-component: for styling components
- recharts: for different charts
- formik: for handling forms
- jest: unit testing
- react-testing-library: component testing


We could ahve achieve functionality for this task with React 
local state or using with useReducer but for scalability purposes 
for upcoming features or screens we are using redux as state 
managment solution. 

## Responsiveness
Its mostly responsive but some minor tweeks may have required. 
Here to complete the task functionality we have decided to follow 
basic layout , UI and UX can be improved as per the design requirements

## TypeSafety
Here its using Proptypes for type safety but in case required we can easily integrate Typescript to avoid run time errors.

## Testing 
As mentioned in the task , only form component validations related 
tests have been added. Other UI testing and redux store testing 
can be done. 


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
